This git repository serves as my personal coding portfolio.
The directories in this top level each represent some coding/machine learning/data visualization project I have worked on.
Languages used include Python, C++, C, Octave, BASH scripting, and even good ol Fortran.

In case I don't get around to putting a README in each project directory, here are some brief descriptions of the projects:

./bmpLibrary

Written in C, the programs in this library give me the ability to create bitmap images from raw numeric data.
I have applied this to two visualization projects:
* Rational points on algebraic surfaces (e.g. plotting points on the unit
  sphere with simple rational coordinates)
* Plotting some orbits of actions of some subgroups of SL_2(Z). This turned out
  to be useful in tying up a loose end in my Ph.D. dissertation in algebraic geometry!

./kaggleAmesHousing

(work in progress)

Written in Python using Pandas and friends, this is my attempt at the Ames Housing Market competition on Kaggle
(https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)

./powerliftingStatistics

(work in progress)

Some basic statistical analysis of USAPL meet data. HTML web scraping with pandas and analysis/plotting in GNU Octave.
Mainly aimed at exploring the goodness of the Wilks coefficient currently used to normalize scores across weight classes in powerlifting.

./projectEuler

Just some problems I've solved from Project Euler. Lots done in Fortran :)
