Bottom row is all OOO...OC
2nd row rules:
If E -> E or O or C
if C -> E
if O -> O or C

These rules are just restricted in higher rows.
If E and below is E, only E
If E and below is C, only E or C
If E and below is O, then E or C or O
if C and below is E, only E
if C and below is C, only E
if C and below is O, only E
if O and below is E, impossible
if O and below is C, only C
if O and below is O, then O or C

So for a h = 2, state is in ZZ^3, starting vector is [1,0,0]t

matrix is 
[1, 1, 0]
[1, 0, 1]
[1, 0, 1]


Row 3 also has a state in ZZ^3, but since the outcome depends on the row below, we need a map ZZ^3(*)ZZ^3 to ZZ^3
Might as well cast it as A:ZZ^3(*)ZZ^3 --> ZZ^3(*)ZZ^3
It's just that post composing with the integration map ZZ^3(*)ZZ^3 --> ZZ^3 factors through the same map on the domain.

A^2 v0 = [2,2,2]
