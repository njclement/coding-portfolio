x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 1
(t,-t,1) is a straight line through this surface
BP = (0,0,1)
direction = (1,-1,0)t
(1,-1,0)
(s,0,1)

perp is 
(-1,-1,s)
(1,1,-s)
x + y - s(z-1) = 0
isect with the surface
x = -y + s(z-1)
-y^3 + 3s y^2(z-1) - 3s^2 y(z-1)^2 + s^3(z-1)^3 +y^3 + z^3 = 1
3s y^2(z-1) - 3s^2 y(z-1)^2 + (z-1)^3 + z^3 = 1
s(z-1)(3y^2 - 3s y(z-1) + s^2 (z-1)^2  + 2z^2 - z + 2) = 0

what about just x + y = 0?
then x = -y 
cubic reduces to z^3 = 1
